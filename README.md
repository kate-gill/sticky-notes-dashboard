# Sticky Notes Dashboard

Sticky Notes Dashboard is a digital sticky note app that enables users to create and save notes.

The Notes Dashboard includes a mini weather app that displays the current weather forecast. By default, the app is set to display weather information for London, UK. However, users can customize the location to see the weather forecast for their preferred location.

The app also offers two themes - Light Blue and Midnight Purple - to cater to users' personal preferences. Location, preferred theme, and notes are saved to local storage.

This app has been developed using React Hooks and is mobile-friendly. The design is styled using CSS Grid Layout and Flexbox, while weather information is sourced from the OpenWeatherMap API.
